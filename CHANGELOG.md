# CHANGELOG

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Pessimistic locks (lockForUpdate/sharedLock) bypass cache
- exists() uses cached select path when not locked
- Added invalidation for insertUsing/insertOrIgnoreUsing/updateFrom
- Tag sets self-heal on cache hits (idempotent SADD)
- Cache::flush() prefers non-blocking UNLINK (falls back to DEL)

### Fixed

- Reflector detects joinSub tables and strips aliases across from/join/where
- Reflector handles Expression columns and improves UNION/EXISTS traversal
- exclude_tables respected by Manager
